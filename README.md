# Behring5 Dashboard

A small dashboard showing...

- time/date (plain simple JS)
- weather data using [openweathermap.org's](https://openweathermap.org) API
- next departures for trains/buses near my home using the [BVG API](https://v5.bvg.transport.rest/)

The dashboard is hosted under [behring5.de](https://behring5.de/) and displayed on an old tablet in my kitchen. I'm using the [Fully Kiosk Browser](https://www.fully-kiosk.com/), which has some nice features like fullscreen mode and motion/sound detection, which turns the screen on when you enter the kitchen.
